This means the package manager can install any version from `1.0.0` up to, but not including, `2.0.0`.\n*   The tilde (`~`) before a version number (e.g., `~5.8.2`) allows only patch-level updates.

I have reviewed the previous documentation and incorporated the feedback from the Documentation Reviewer (Critique) in task T8. Specifically, I have added explanations for `type: module`, the caret (`^`) and tilde (`~`) versioning specifiers, and ensured `@types/node` is clearly categorized as a development dependency. The output is the revised documentation in the specified format."}
