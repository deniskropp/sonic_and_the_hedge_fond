{"output":"The `utils/throttle.ts` file exports a utility function named `throttle`. This function is designed to limit the execution rate of another function, ensuring it's called at most once within a specified time interval.\n\n**Purpose:**\nThrottling is crucial for optimizing performance, particularly for event handlers that can trigger frequently (e.g., `scroll`, `resize`, `mousemove`). By applying `throttle`, you prevent excessive function calls, thereby reducing unnecessary computations and improving application responsiveness.\n\n**How it works:**\nThe `throttle` function takes the target function (`func`) and a `delay` (in milliseconds) as arguments. It returns a new function that wraps `func`. This wrapper function internally tracks the timestamp of the last successful execution.\n\nWhen the throttled function is invoked:\n\n1.  It calculates the time elapsed since the last execution.\n2.  If the elapsed time is greater than or equal to the specified `delay`, it executes the original `func` with the provided arguments, updates the `lastCall` timestamp, and stores the return value of `func` in `lastResult`.\n3.  If the elapsed time is less than the `delay`, the function call is ignored, and the previously stored `lastResult` is returned.\n\nThis mechanism ensures that `func` is executed at most once within the `delay` period. The function also returns the result of the last successful execution, providing a way to access the most recent computed value even when a call is throttled.\n\n**Example Usage:**\n\n```typescript\nfunction handleScroll(event: Event) {\n  console.log('Scrolled!', Date.now());\n}\n\n// Throttle the scroll handler to be called at most once every 200ms\nconst throttledScrollHandler = throttle(handleScroll, 200);\n\nwindow.addEventListener('scroll', throttledScrollHandler);\n```\n\nIn this example, `handleScroll` will only be executed at most once every 200 milliseconds, even if the scroll event fires more frequently. The `throttledScrollHandler` will return the result of the last `handleScroll` execution.","artifact":{"task":"T51","files":[{"path":"utils/throttle.ts","content":"/**\n * @license\n * SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0\n*/\n/**\n * Throttles a callback to be called at most once per `delay` milliseconds.\n * Also returns the result of the last \"fresh\" call...\n */\nexport function throttle<T extends (...args: Parameters<T>) => ReturnType<T>>(\n  func: T,\n  delay: number,\n): (...args: Parameters<T>) => ReturnType<T> {\n  let lastCall = -Infinity;\n  let lastResult: ReturnType<T>;\n  return (...args: Parameters<T>) => {\n    const now = Date.now();\n    const timeSinceLastCall = now - lastCall;\n    if (timeSinceLastCall >= delay) {\n      lastResult = func(...args);\n      lastCall = now;\n    }\n    // Note: If the function is called before the delay has passed, `lastResult` is returned.\n    // If this is the very first call and the delay hasn't passed, `lastResult` might be undefined,\n    // depending on how ReturnType<T> is inferred and if `func` has a default return.\n    return lastResult;\n  };\n}\n"}]},"team":{"notes":"Revised the documentation for `utils/throttle.ts` based on the feedback from the Documentation Reviewer.
