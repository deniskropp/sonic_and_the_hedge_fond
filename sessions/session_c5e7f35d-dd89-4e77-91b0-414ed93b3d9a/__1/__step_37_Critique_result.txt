{"output":"The documentation for `utils/AudioAnalyser.ts` needs refinement. While it correctly identifies the purpose of the class (monitoring audio levels using `AnalyserNode`), the generated Markdown documentation lacks some crucial details and could be clearer. Specifically:\n\n1.  **Clarity of `getCurrentLevel()`:** The explanation of how the average is calculated and normalized is present but could be more explicit. It should be clear that `freqData` holds magnitude values for different frequency bins and that the average is taken across all these bins.\n2.  **`loop()` Method Explanation:** The description of `loop()` correctly mentions `requestAnimationFrame` and dispatching the event. However, it should also clarify that `loop()` itself is intended to be called via `requestAnimationFrame` internally, and `start()` is the public method to initiate this loop.\n3.  **`extraDestination` in `LiveMusicHelper`:** The current documentation for `AudioAnalyser` doesn't mention its role as a potential `extraDestination` for `LiveMusicHelper`. This is a key integration point and should be highlighted.\n4.  **Constructor Details:** While the constructor is mentioned, it would be beneficial to explicitly state that the `AnalyserNode` is created within the constructor and configured.\n5.  **Error Handling/Edge Cases:** The documentation doesn't mention any specific error handling or edge cases, such as what happens if `requestAnimationFrame` fails or if the `AudioContext` is in a suspended state when `start()` is called.\n6.  **Code Snippets:** The usage examples are good, but ensuring they precisely match the provided code and clearly demonstrate the `addEventListener` for `audio-level-changed` is important.\n\nOverall, the documentation is a good starting point, but it needs more technical depth and clarity on the interdependencies and internal workings of the `AudioAnalyser` class.","artifact":null,"team":null,"reasoning":"The user asked me to review the generated documentation for `utils/AudioAnalyser.ts`.
