It leverages AI Studio and Gemini to dynamically generate and manipulate musical prompts based on your MIDI inputs.\n\n## Features\n\n*   **Real-time Music Generation:** Control music generation on the fly.\n*   **MIDI Controller Integration:** Map MIDI control changes (CC) to adjust prompt weights.\n*   **AI-Powered Prompts:** Utilizes Gemini's capabilities for creative music generation.\n*   **Interactive UI:** A visual interface with prompt controllers, play/pause buttons, and MIDI feedback.\n*   **Customizable Prompts:** Define and manage multiple musical prompts with adjustable weights and colors.\n\n## Setup and Running the Project\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n*   Node.js (v18 or higher recommended)\n*   npm or yarn\n*   A MIDI controller (optional, but highly recommended for full functionality)\n*   A Gemini API Key (required for AI music generation)\n\n### Installation\n\n1.  **Clone the repository:**\n    ```bash\n    git clone https://github.com/your-username/promptdj-midi-myfirstanalog.git\n    ```\n    *(Replace `https://github.com/your-username/promptdj-midi-myfirstanalog.git` with the actual repository URL.)*\n\n2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**\n    ```bash\n    cd promptdj-midi-myfirstanalog\n    ```\n\n3.  **Install dependencies:**\n    ```bash\n    npm install\n    # or\n    yarn install\n    ```\n\n4.  **Configure Environment Variables:**\n    Create a `.env` file in the root of the project directory and add your Gemini API Key:\n    ```\n    GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY\n    ```\n    *Note: Ensure your API key is kept confidential and is not committed to version control.* The application requires this key to interact with the Gemini API for music generation.\n\n### Running the Development Server\n\nTo start the development server, run:\n\n```bash\nnpm run dev\n# or\nyarn dev\n```\n\nThis will launch the application on `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified in `vite.config.ts`).\n\n## Usage\n\n1.  **Launch the application:** Open your web browser and navigate to the address provided by the development server (usually `http://localhost:3000`).\n\n2.  **MIDI Controller Setup:**\n    *   Click the \"MIDI\" button to reveal MIDI input options.\n    *   Select your MIDI controller from the dropdown list. If no devices are found, ensure your controller is connected and recognized by your system.\n\n3.  **Controlling Prompts:**\n    *   Each prompt controller has a **Weight Knob**. You can adjust the weight of a prompt by dragging the knob or using your mouse wheel.\n    *   To map a MIDI CC to a prompt's weight, click the \"MIDI\" button to enable MIDI input display, then click the \"Learn\" label on the desired prompt controller. Send a CC message from your MIDI controller, and the prompt will automatically map to that CC.\n    *   The \"Learn\" label will change to display the mapped `CC: [number]`.\n    *   Without a MIDI controller, you can still adjust prompt weights manually using the knobs, but real-time dynamic control will be limited.\n\n4.  **Playback Control:**\n    *   Use the **Play/Pause button** to start, pause, or stop the music generation process.\n    *   The button's state will indicate the current playback status (Stopped, Loading, Playing, Paused).\n\n## Project Structure\n\n*   **`src/`**: Contains the main application source code.\n    *   **`components/`**: LitElement components for UI elements (e.g., `PromptController`, `PlayPauseButton`).\n    *   **`types.ts`**: Defines TypeScript interfaces and types used throughout the project.\n    *   **`utils/`**: Utility functions and classes for audio processing, MIDI handling, and AI interaction.\n*   **`index.tsx`**: The main entry point of the application, responsible for initializing components and setting up event listeners.\n*   **`vite.config.ts`**: Vite build tool configuration.\n\n## Configuration (`vite.config.ts`)\n\nThis project uses Vite for its build process. The `vite.config.ts` file configures the development server and build settings. Key configurations include:\n\n*   `server.port`: Sets the development server port (default: 3000).\n*   `server.host`: Sets the development server host (default: '0.0.0.0', making it accessible on your local network).\n*   `plugins`: An array for Vite plugins (currently empty).\n*   `define`: Used to inject environment variables (like `GEMINI_API_KEY`) into the client-side build.\n*   `resolve.alias`: Configures path aliases for cleaner imports (e.g., `@` for the root directory).\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are welcome! Please refer to the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file (if available) for guidelines on how to contribute.\n\n## License\n\nThis project is licensed under the Apache-2.0 license.\n","artifact":{"task":"T6","files":[{"path":"README.md","content":"## PromptDJ MIDI myfirstanalog\n\n<div align=\"center\">\n\n<img width=\"1200\" height=\"475\" alt=\"PromptDJ MIDI myfirstanalog Project Banner\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0aa67016-6eaf-458a-adb2-6e31a0763ed6\" />\n\n  <h1>Built with AI Studio</h1>\n\n  <p>The fastest path from prompt to production with Gemini.</p>\n\n  <a href=\"https://aistudio.google.com/apps\">Start building</a>\n\n</div>\n\n## Overview\n\nPromptDJ MIDI myfirstanalog is a creative application that allows you to control real-time music generation using a MIDI controller.

Replacing the placeholder repository URL with a more descriptive placeholder and a note to replace it.\n2.  Explicitly stating the necessity of the `GEMINI_API_KEY` and advising on its confidentiality.\n3.  Clarifying why a MIDI controller is recommended and what functionality is limited without one.\n4.  Expanding the explanation of the \"Learn\" mode.\n5.  Updating the `alt` text for the banner image.\n6.  Correcting minor grammatical inconsistencies and typos.\n7.  Adding a section detailing relevant `vite.config.ts` configurations.\n\nThe artifact now contains the revised `README.md` content."}
