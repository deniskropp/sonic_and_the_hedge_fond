{"output":"Hello Lex and Critique! I'm here to facilitate our knowledge transfer regarding the PromptDJ MIDI myfirstanalog project. Our collective goal is to document this project thoroughly. \n\n**Project Overview:**\nThe PromptDJ MIDI myfirstanalog project is a web application that allows users to control real-time music generation using a MIDI controller. It leverages AI, specifically Google's Gemini models (Lyria-realtime-exp), to generate music based on text prompts. These prompts can be dynamically controlled and mapped to MIDI Continuous Controller (CC) messages. The project is built using LitElement for web components and Vite for its build process.\n\n**Architecture:**\n- **Frontend:** Primarily built with LitElement, creating reusable web components for UI elements like buttons, knobs, and controllers. The main application logic resides in `index.tsx`.\n- **AI Integration:** Uses the `@google/genai` library to interact with the Lyria-realtime-exp model for music generation.\n- **MIDI Control:** Employs the Web MIDI API through a `MidiDispatcher` utility to map MIDI CC messages to prompt weights and other controls.\n- **Audio Handling:** Includes utilities for audio analysis (`AudioAnalyser`), decoding/encoding (`audio.ts`), and managing audio playback (`LiveMusicHelper`).\n- **State Management:** Primarily managed within components and passed down via properties and events. `PromptController` components manage individual prompt settings.\n- **Build Tool:** Vite is used for development, building, and previewing the application.\n\n**Documentation Requirements:**\nWe have a set of Task Agnostic Steps (TAS) that need to be addressed. For each TAS, Lex will generate the initial documentation, and Critique will review it. My role here is to ensure you both understand the context and the specific requirements for each task.\n\n**Lex (Documentation Writer):** Your prompts guide you to create documentation for various parts of the project. Remember to refer to the provided code snippets for accuracy. Focus on explaining the 'what,' 'why,' and 'how' of each piece of code or configuration.\n\n**Critique (Documentation Reviewer):** Your prompts guide you to critically evaluate Lex's output. Ensure you are providing specific, actionable feedback based on clarity, accuracy, completeness, and adherence to technical writing standards. Your goal is to refine the documentation.\n\n**Key Files and Their Roles:**\n- `README.md`: Project overview, setup, and usage.\n- `package.json`: Project dependencies and scripts.\n- `metadata.json`: Application metadata for AI Studio.\n- `tsconfig.json`: TypeScript compiler options.\n- `components/`: Directory containing UI web components (e.g., `PlayPauseButton`, `PromptController`, `WeightKnob`).\n- `utils/`: Directory for utility functions (e.g., `MidiDispatcher`, `AudioAnalyser`, `throttle`).\n- `index.tsx`: Main application entry point.\n- `types.ts`: Defines core data structures.\n- `vite.config.ts`: Vite build configuration.\n\nLet's proceed with the tasks. Lex, you should expect to receive the first prompt for generating documentation based on the identified TAS. Critique, you will then review Lex's output. I'm here to clarify any points as we go.\n\nAre you both ready to begin with the first documentation task?","artifact":null,"team":{"notes":"Provided context and knowledge transfer to Lex and Critique regarding the PromptDJ MIDI myfirstanalog project, its architecture, and the specific documentation requirements for each TAS. This sets the stage for the subsequent documentation generation and review tasks.","prompts":[]},"reasoning":"As the AI Tutor, my sub-task is to provide context and knowledge transfer to Lex and Critique. I have synthesized the information about the project's goal, architecture, and the roles of Lex and Critique. I've outlined the key files and their purposes, and explicitly stated the documentation requirements for each TAS. The output is a conversational message aimed at ensuring both agents have a shared understanding before proceeding with their respective tasks. This fulfills the 'Knowledge transfer between spaces' goal."}
