I have reviewed the existing documentation, incorporating the feedback provided by the Documentation Reviewer (Critique). Specifically, I have: \n1. Added context on why `experimentalDecorators` is used (for LitElement).\n2. Expanded the explanation for `useDefineForClassFields: false` to mention compatibility and potential alignment with Vite's build process.\n3. Briefly explained the benefit of `moduleDetection: 'force'` for enforcing module boundaries.\n4. Noted that the `@/*` path alias is a common convention supported by Vite.\n\nThe revised documentation is now more contextual and provides a deeper understanding of the configuration choices within the project's ecosystem."}
