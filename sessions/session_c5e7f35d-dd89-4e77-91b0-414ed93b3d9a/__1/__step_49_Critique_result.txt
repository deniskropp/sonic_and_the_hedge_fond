{"output":"The documentation for `utils/throttle.ts` is generally good, clearly explaining the purpose and mechanism of the `throttle` function. However, it could be improved with a few specific additions:\n\n1.  **Code Example:** Including a small, illustrative code example would significantly enhance understanding. Demonstrating how to use the `throttle` function with a hypothetical event handler would make its practical application concrete.\n2.  **Return Value Clarification:** The description mentions that the throttled function \"returns the `lastResult` from the previous successful execution.\" While accurate, it could be more explicit about what `lastResult` is and when it's returned (i.e., when the function is *not* executed due to the delay).\n3.  **Type Safety:** The current description implies the function returns the `ReturnType<T>`, but doesn't explicitly mention the handling of cases where `func` might not return a value or if `lastResult` is initially undefined before the first successful call.\n4.  **File Path Correction:** The artifact path is `utils/throttle.ts.md`. The task was to review `utils/throttle.ts`, so the documentation file should reflect this. If the intention is to generate markdown, the path should be more descriptive, e.g., `docs/utils/throttle.md` or similar.\n\n**Specific Feedback:**\n\n*   **Clarity:** The explanation of 'How it works' is clear. The purpose is well-defined.\n*   **Accuracy:** The technical description of throttling is accurate.\n*   **Completeness:** Lacks a code example and a more detailed explanation of the return value when the function is not executed.\n*   **Grammar:** No grammatical errors found.\n*   **Style Guide:** Assumed standard markdown for documentation.","artifact":{"task":"T50","files":[{"path":"utils/throttle.ts.md","content":"The `utils/throttle.ts` file exports a single utility function, `throttle`. This function is designed to limit the rate at which another function can be called. It takes two arguments: the function to throttle (`func`) and the minimum delay in milliseconds (`delay`) between calls.\n\n**Purpose:**\nThrottling is useful for performance optimization, especially for event handlers that might fire rapidly (e.g., scroll, resize, or input events). By throttling such functions, you ensure they are executed at most once within the specified delay, preventing excessive computations or UI updates.\n\n**How it works:**\nThe `throttle` function returns a new function that wraps the original `func`. This new function keeps track of the last time `func` was called. When the throttled function is invoked, it checks if enough time has passed since the last execution (i.e., if `Date.now() - lastCall >= delay`).\n\n- If the delay has passed, it executes the original `func` with the provided arguments, updates `lastCall` to the current time, and stores the result of `func`.\n- If the delay has not passed, it does nothing but returns the `lastResult` from the previous successful execution.\n\nThis ensures that `func` is called at most once per `delay` interval, while still returning the most recent valid result."}]},"team":{"notes":"Reviewed the documentation for `utils/throttle.ts`.
