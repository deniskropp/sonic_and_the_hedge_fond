{"output":"Critique's Review of PromptController.ts Documentation:\n\nOverall, the generated documentation for `PromptController.ts` is comprehensive and well-structured. It effectively explains the component's purpose, functionality, properties, and methods. The inclusion of a usage example is also very helpful.\n\nHere are a few specific points for improvement:\n\n1.  **Clarity on `channel` Property:** The documentation states that the `channel` property is 'currently not explicitly used in logic but available.' While this is accurate, it might be beneficial to briefly elaborate on *why* it's available or what its intended future use might be, if known. If there's no planned use, simply stating it's unused and might be a remnant is sufficient.\n\n2.  **MIDI CC Mapping Detail:** In the 'MIDI CC Mapping' section, the description could be slightly more explicit about the interaction between `learnMode`, the 'MIDI' button, and the `cc` property. For instance, mentioning that clicking the 'MIDI' button toggles `learnMode` and that the `cc` property is updated *after* a CC message is received while in learn mode would add clarity.\n\n3.  **`update(changedProperties)` Method Explanation:** The explanation for `update(changedProperties)` is good, but it could be more specific about *how* it ensures the text input reflects the `text` property. Mentioning that it sets `this.textInput.textContent = this.text;` would be a useful detail.\n\n4.  **Consistency in `WeightKnob` Interaction:** The documentation for `WeightKnob` mentions it can 'optionally display an audio level.' The `PromptController` documentation also mentions `audioLevel` is used to potentially influence the `WeightKnob` visualization. It would be good to explicitly state that the `audioLevel` property is passed down to the `WeightKnob` to achieve this visualization.\n\n5.  **Minor Wording:** In the 'Usage Example,' `midiDispatcherInstance` and `handlePromptChange` are used. It would be beneficial to add a note that these are placeholders and would need to be defined in the actual implementation context.\n\nThese are minor points that aim to enhance the already solid documentation. The technical accuracy and clarity are generally high.","artifact":{"task":"T20","files":[{"path":"components/PromptController.md","content":"## Component: PromptController\n\n### Purpose\n\nThe `PromptController` component is a custom web component responsible for managing individual music prompts within the PromptDJ MIDI application. It provides a user interface for editing prompt text, adjusting its associated weight (which influences its prominence in the AI-generated music), and mapping it to a MIDI Continuous Controller (CC) message for real-time control. It also visualizes the prompt's weight and provides a mechanism for entering 'learn mode' to assign MIDI CCs.\n\n### Functionality\n\n*   **Prompt Text Input:** Allows users to enter and edit the text for a specific musical prompt. It supports editing directly within the component and includes keyboard shortcuts for saving (Enter) and resetting (Escape).\n*   **Weight Adjustment:** Integrates with a `WeightKnob` component to visually represent and allow adjustment of the prompt's weight. The weight is a numerical value that influences how strongly the AI considers this prompt. The `audioLevel` property is passed to the `WeightKnob` to potentially influence its visualization.\n*   **MIDI CC Mapping:** Enables users to map a MIDI CC message to control the prompt's weight. When in 'learn mode,' the component listens for incoming CC messages and assigns the received CC number to the prompt. Clicking the 'MIDI' button toggles 'learn mode.' This allows for real-time manipulation of prompt influence using a MIDI controller.\n*   **Visual Feedback:**\n    *   The `WeightKnob` component visually indicates the current weight and can optionally display an audio level.\n    *   The component itself can be visually `filtered` (indicated by a red background on the text input and reduced opacity on the knob) if the AI deems the prompt unsuitable.\n    *   The 'MIDI' button displays the currently mapped CC number or 'Learn' when in learn mode.\n*   **Event Emission:**\n    *   `prompt-changed`: Emits a custom event whenever the prompt's text, weight, CC, or color changes. This event carries the updated `Prompt` object.\n\n### Properties\n\n*   `promptId` (String): A unique identifier for the prompt.\n*   `text` (String): The text content of the prompt.\n*   `weight` (Number): The current weight of the prompt (typically between 0 and 2).\n*   `color` (String): The color associated with the prompt, used for visual styling.\n*   `filtered` (Boolean, reflect): Indicates if the prompt has been filtered by the AI. This affects the component's styling.\n*   `cc` (Number): The MIDI CC number currently mapped to this prompt.\n*   `channel` (Number): The MIDI channel mapped to this prompt (currently not explicitly used in logic but available; intended for future use or a remnant).\n*   `learnMode` (Boolean): A flag to indicate if the component is currently in MIDI CC learn mode.\n*   `showCC` (Boolean): Controls the visibility of the MIDI CC display and learn mode toggle.\n*   `midiDispatcher` (MidiDispatcher | null): An instance of `MidiDispatcher` used to listen for incoming MIDI CC messages.\n*   `audioLevel` (Number): The current audio analysis level, used to potentially influence the `WeightKnob` visualization.\n\n### Methods\n\n*   `connectedCallback()`: Initializes event listeners for MIDI CC messages when the component is added to the DOM. It handles updating the prompt's weight based on received CC values or updating the mapped CC when in learn mode.\n*   `firstUpdated()`: Sets up the `contenteditable` attribute for the text input and initializes its content.\n*   `update(changedProperties)`: Handles updates to properties, ensuring the text input reflects the `text` property by setting `this.textInput.textContent = this.text;` and managing the `learnMode` state when `showCC` changes.\n*   `dispatchPromptChange()`: A private method to dispatch the `prompt-changed` custom event with the current prompt details.\n*   `onKeyDown(e: KeyboardEvent)`: Handles keyboard events for the text input, specifically for 'Enter' to save and 'Escape' to reset.\n*   `resetText()`: Resets the prompt text to its last valid state.\n*   `updateText()`: Updates the prompt's text property and dispatches the `prompt-changed` event after the user finishes editing.\n*   `onFocus()`: Selects the content of the text input when it gains focus.\n*   `updateWeight()`: Updates the prompt's weight based on input from the `WeightKnob` and dispatches the `prompt-changed` event.\n*   `toggleLearnMode()`: Toggles the `learnMode` property.\n\n### Usage Example\n\n```html\n<prompt-controller\n  promptId=\"prompt-0\"\n  text=\"Bossa Nova\"\n  weight=\"1.5\"\n  color=\"#9900ff\"\n  .midiDispatcher=${midiDispatcherInstance} // Placeholder for an actual MidiDispatcher instance\n  ?showCC=${true}\n  @prompt-changed=${handlePromptChange}> // Placeholder for an event handler function\n</prompt-controller>\n```\n\nThis component is crucial for allowing users to define and control the various musical elements that the AI will generate, providing a direct link between MIDI input and the creative output."}]},"team":null,"reasoning":null}
