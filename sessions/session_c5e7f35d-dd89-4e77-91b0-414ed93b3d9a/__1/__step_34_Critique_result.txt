{"output":"The documentation for `types.ts` is generally clear and accurate. It correctly identifies and describes the `Prompt`, `ControlChange`, and `PlaybackState` types. However, there are a few areas that could be improved for greater clarity and completeness:\n\n1.  **Overall Description:** The initial sentence, \"This ensures type safety and provides a clear understanding of the data being passed between different parts of the application,\" is good, but could be slightly more specific. It would be beneficial to mention *why* these types are important in the context of the PromptDJ MIDI project (e.g., for managing prompts, MIDI input, and playback state).\n\n2.  **`Prompt` Interface - `weight` Property:** The description \"The current weight or intensity of the prompt, typically ranging from 0 to 2\" is accurate. However, it could be more explicit about *how* this weight is used. For instance, mentioning that it influences the AI's generation or the prompt's prominence in the mix would add valuable context.\n\n3.  **`Prompt` Interface - `cc` Property:** The description \"The MIDI Continuous Controller (CC) number mapped to this prompt's weight\" is correct. To enhance clarity, you could add a note that this mapping is crucial for controlling prompts via external MIDI hardware.\n\n4.  **`PlaybackState` Type:** The list of states is accurate. It would be helpful to briefly explain what each state signifies in the context of the application's operation (e.g., 'loading' means the AI is generating audio, 'playing' means audio is actively being streamed or played back).\n\n5.  **Code Formatting:** While the markdown formatting for the properties is generally good, ensure consistent use of backticks for code elements like property names and types throughout all documentation. The current output uses backticks for property names but not for types like `string` or `number` in the descriptions.","artifact":{"task":"Document Types and Interfaces","files":[{"path":"types.ts","content":"/**\n * @license\n * SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0\n*/\n\n/**\n * Defines the core data structures and interfaces used throughout the PromptDJ MIDI myfirstanalog project.\n * This ensures type safety and provides a clear understanding of the data being passed between different parts of the application.\n */\n\n/**\n * Represents a single controllable prompt within the application.\n */\nexport interface Prompt {\n  readonly promptId: string;\n  text: string;\n  weight: number;\n  cc: number;\n  color: string;\n}\n\n/**\n * Represents a MIDI Control Change (CC) message.\n */\nexport interface ControlChange {\n  channel: number;\n  cc: number;\n  value: number;\n}\n\n/**\n * Defines the possible states of the music playback.\n */\nexport type PlaybackState = 'stopped' | 'playing' | 'loading' | 'paused';\n"}]},"team":null,"reasoning":null}
