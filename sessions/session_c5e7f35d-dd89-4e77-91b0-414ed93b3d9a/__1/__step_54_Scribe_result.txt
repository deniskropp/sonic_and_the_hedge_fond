It leverages AI Studio and Gemini to dynamically generate and manipulate musical prompts based on your MIDI inputs.\n\n## Features\n\n*   **Real-time Music Generation:** Control music generation on the fly.\n*   **MIDI Controller Integration:** Map MIDI control changes (CC) to adjust prompt weights.\n*   **AI-Powered Prompts:** Utilizes Gemini's capabilities for creative music generation.\n*   **Interactive UI:** A visual interface with prompt controllers, play/pause buttons, and MIDI feedback.\n*   **Customizable Prompts:** Define and manage multiple musical prompts with adjustable weights and colors.\n\n## Setup and Running the Project\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n*   Node.js (v18 or higher recommended)\n*   npm or yarn\n*   A MIDI controller (optional, but highly recommended for full functionality)\n*   A Gemini API Key (required for AI music generation)\n\n### Installation\n\n1.  **Clone the repository:**\n    ```bash\n    git clone https://github.com/your-username/promptdj-midi-myfirstanalog.git\n    ```\n    *(Replace `https://github.com/your-username/promptdj-midi-myfirstanalog.git` with the actual repository URL.)*\n\n2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**\n    ```bash\n    cd promptdj-midi-myfirstanalog\n    ```\n\n3.  **Install dependencies:**\n    ```bash\n    npm install\n    # or\n    yarn install\n    ```\n\n4.  **Configure Environment Variables:**\n    Create a `.env` file in the root of the project directory and add your Gemini API Key:\n    ```\n    GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY\n    ```\n    *Note: Ensure your API key is kept confidential and is not committed to version control.* The application requires this key to interact with the Gemini API for music generation.\n\n### Running the Development Server\n\nTo start the development server, run:\n\n```bash\nnpm run dev\n# or\nyarn dev\n```\n\nThis will launch the application on `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified in `vite.config.ts`).\n\n## Usage\n\n1.  **Launch the application:** Open your web browser and navigate to the address provided by the development server (usually `http://localhost:3000`).\n\n2.  **MIDI Controller Setup:**\n    *   Click the \"MIDI\" button to reveal MIDI input options.\n    *   Select your MIDI controller from the dropdown list. If no devices are found, ensure your controller is connected and recognized by your system.\n\n3.  **Controlling Prompts:**\n    *   Each prompt controller has a **Weight Knob**. You can adjust the weight of a prompt by dragging the knob or using your mouse wheel.\n    *   To map a MIDI CC to a prompt's weight, click the \"MIDI\" button to enable MIDI input display, then click the \"Learn\" label on the desired prompt controller. Send a CC message from your MIDI controller, and the prompt will automatically map to that CC.\n    *   The \"Learn\" label will change to display the mapped `CC: [number]`.\n    *   Without a MIDI controller, you can still adjust prompt weights manually using the knobs, but real-time dynamic control will be limited.\n\n4.  **Playback Control:**\n    *   Use the **Play/Pause button** to start, pause, or stop the music generation process.\n    *   The button's state will indicate the current playback status (Stopped, Loading, Playing, Paused).\n\n## Project Structure\n\n*   **`src/`**: Contains the main application source code.\n    *   **`components/`**: LitElement components for UI elements (e.g., `PromptController`, `PlayPauseButton`).\n    *   **`types.ts`**: Defines TypeScript interfaces and types used throughout the project.\n    *   **`utils/`**: Utility functions and classes for audio processing, MIDI handling, and AI interaction.\n*   **`index.tsx`**: The main entry point of the application, responsible for initializing components and setting up event listeners.\n*   **`vite.config.ts`**: Vite build tool configuration.\n\n## Configuration (`vite.config.ts`)\n\nThis project uses Vite for its build process. The `vite.config.ts` file configures the development server and build settings. Key configurations include:\n\n*   `server.port`: Sets the development server port (default: 3000).\n*   `server.host`: Sets the development server host (default: '0.0.0.0', making it accessible on your local network).\n*   `plugins`: An array for Vite plugins (currently empty).\n*   `define`: Used to inject environment variables (like `GEMINI_API_KEY`) into the client-side build.\n*   `resolve.alias`: Configures path aliases for cleaner imports (e.g., `@` for the root directory).\n\n## Contributing\n\nContributions are welcome!

In this project, this array is empty, indicating no special frame permissions are required.\n\n*   **`prompt`**: (String) An optional field that can contain an initial prompt or configuration passed to the underlying AI model or system. In the context of PromptDJ, this field might be used to provide an initial directive or theme to the AI music generation model when the application starts. If the application were designed to start with a specific musical theme, this field might contain a prompt such as `'Create a melancholic piano melody.'`. Currently, it is an empty string `\"\"`, meaning no initial prompt is provided.\n"},{"path":"tsconfig.json","content":"## TypeScript Configuration (`tsconfig.json`)\n\nThe `tsconfig.json` file configures the TypeScript compiler for the project. It specifies options for how TypeScript code should be compiled into JavaScript, including target ECMAScript version, module system, type checking, and path aliases.\n\n### Compiler Options:\n\n*   **`target`: `ES2022`**\n    *   Specifies the ECMAScript target version for compiled JavaScript output. `ES2022` ensures modern JavaScript features are supported and can be used directly, aligning with current browser and Node.js standards.\n*   **`experimentalDecorators`: `true`**\n    *   Enables experimental support for ES decorators. This is often required by libraries like Lit (used in this project) for declarative element definitions (`@customElement`, `@property`, etc.).\n*   **`useDefineForClassFields`: `false`**\n    *   Controls how class fields are defined. Setting this to `false` maintains compatibility with older JavaScript class field proposals or specific transpilation behaviors, potentially aligning with Vite's build process and ensuring consistent behavior across different environments.\n*   **`module`: `ESNext`**\n    *   Sets the module system for the output. `ESNext` indicates that the compiler should use the latest ECMAScript module syntax, which is standard for modern web development and compatible with Vite's module handling.\n*   **`lib`**: `[\"ES2022\", \"DOM\", \"DOM.Iterable\"]`\n    *   Specifies the built-in libraries to be included in the compilation context. This ensures that types for modern JavaScript (`ES2022`), the Document Object Model (`DOM`), and iterable protocols (`DOM.Iterable`) are available during development.\n*   **`skipLibCheck`: `true`**\n    *   Skips type checking of declaration files (`.d.ts`). This can significantly speed up compilation times, especially in projects with many third-party libraries, by avoiding redundant checks.\n*   **`types`: `[\"node\"]`**\n    *   Includes type definitions for Node.js. This is useful for projects that might use Node.js-specific APIs or run in a Node.js environment (e.g., during the build process).\n*   **`moduleResolution`: `bundler`**\n    *   Configures how modules are resolved. `bundler` mode is optimized for module bundlers like Vite, ensuring efficient and predictable module resolution.\n*   **`isolatedModules`: `true`**\n    *   Ensures that each file can be transpiled independently without any loss of information. This is a common requirement for modern build tools and supports features like hot module replacement.\n*   **`moduleDetection`: `force`**\n    *   Forces the compiler to use ES module detection, even in CommonJS files. This helps enforce module boundaries and prevent accidental script-like behavior, promoting a more robust module system.\n*   **`allowJs`: `true`**\n    *   Allows JavaScript files to be included in the compilation. This is useful for gradual adoption of TypeScript or when integrating with existing JavaScript code.\n*   **`jsx`: `react-jsx`**\n    *   Specifies the JSX transform. `react-jsx` enables the use of JSX syntax, commonly used in React and compatible frameworks. While this project uses Lit, this setting might be a remnant or intended for potential future use or integration with tools that expect JSX.\n*   **`paths`: `{\"@/*\": [\"./*\"]}`**\n    *   Defines a path mapping, allowing the use of the `@` alias to import modules from the project's root directory (e.g., `@/utils/audio` instead of `../../utils/audio`). This improves import clarity and maintainability. This is a common convention supported by Vite for organizing project-level imports.\n*   **`allowImportingTsExtensions`: `true`**\n    *   Enables importing TypeScript files (`.ts`, `.tsx`) directly, even if they have extensions that are typically ignored by default (like `.jsx`). This works well with Vite's module handling.\n*   **`noEmit`: `true`**\n    *   Instructs the TypeScript compiler not to emit output files (JavaScript). This is common when using a bundler like Vite, which handles the compilation and bundling process itself."},{"path":"components/PlayPauseButton.md","content":"## Component: PlayPauseButton\n\n### Purpose\n\nThe `PlayPauseButton` component is a custom HTML element (`<play-pause-button>`) that visually represents the playback state of the music player and allows users to control it via a click interaction. It utilizes LitElement for its framework and SVG for its graphical representation.\n\n### Functionality\n\nThis component displays one of three icons based on the `playbackState` property:\n\n*   **`'playing'`**: Displays a pause icon.\n*   **`'loading'`**: Displays a spinning loader icon.\n*   **`'stopped'`** (and `'paused'`): Displays a play icon.\n\nClicking the button triggers a `click` event, which can be used by a parent component to control the playback.\n\n### Properties\n\n*   **`playbackState`**: (Type: `PlaybackState`, Default: `'stopped'`) \n    The current state of the music playback. This property determines which icon is displayed.\n    Accepted values are: `'stopped'`, `'playing'`, `'loading'`, and `'paused'`.\n\n### Events\n\n*   **`click`**: Dispatched when the button is clicked. This event does not carry any specific data in its `detail` property.\n\n### Styling\n\nThe component includes internal styles for:\n\n*   Centering the icon within the host element.\n*   A hover effect that scales the SVG.\n*   A spinning animation for the loader icon.\n*   A `hitbox` div to make the entire clickable area responsive.\n\n### Usage Example\n\n```html\n<play-pause-button playback-state=\"playing\"></play-pause-button>\n\n<script>\n  const button = document.querySelector('play-pause-button');\n  button.addEventListener('click', () => {\n    console.log('Play/Pause button clicked!');\n    // Add logic here to toggle playback\n  });\n  // To change the state dynamically:\n  // button.playbackState = 'loading';\n</script>\n```"},{"path":"components/PromptController.md","content":"## Component: PromptController\n\n### Purpose\n\nThe `PromptController` component is a custom web component responsible for managing individual music prompts within the PromptDJ MIDI application. It provides a user interface for editing prompt text, adjusting its associated weight (which influences its prominence in the AI-generated music), and mapping it to a MIDI Continuous Controller (CC) message for real-time control. It also visualizes the prompt's weight and provides a mechanism for entering 'learn mode' to assign MIDI CCs.\n\n### Functionality\n\n*   **Prompt Text Input:** Allows users to enter and edit the text for a specific musical prompt. It supports editing directly within the component and includes keyboard shortcuts for saving (Enter) and resetting (Escape).\n*   **Weight Adjustment:** Integrates with a `WeightKnob` component to visually represent and allow adjustment of the prompt's weight. The weight is a numerical value that influences how strongly the AI considers this prompt. The `audioLevel` property is passed to the `WeightKnob` to potentially influence its visualization.\n*   **MIDI CC Mapping:** Enables users to map a MIDI CC message to control the prompt's weight. When in 'learn mode,' the component listens for incoming CC messages and assigns the received CC number to the prompt. Clicking the 'MIDI' button toggles `learnMode`. The `cc` property is updated after a CC message is received while in learn mode.\n*   **Visual Feedback:**\n    *   The `WeightKnob` component visually indicates the current weight and can optionally display an audio level.\n    *   The component itself can be visually `filtered` (indicated by a red background on the text input and reduced opacity on the knob) if the AI deems the prompt unsuitable.\n    *   The 'MIDI' button displays the currently mapped CC number or 'Learn' when in learn mode.\n*   **Event Emission:**\n    *   `prompt-changed`: Emits a custom event whenever the prompt's text, weight, CC, or color changes. This event carries the updated `Prompt` object.\n\n### Properties\n\n*   `promptId` (String): A unique identifier for the prompt.\n*   `text` (String): The text content of the prompt.\n*   `weight` (Number): The current weight of the prompt (typically between 0 and 2).\n*   `color` (String): The color associated with the prompt, used for visual styling.\n*   `filtered` (Boolean, reflect): Indicates if the prompt has been filtered by the AI. This affects the component's styling.\n*   `cc` (Number): The MIDI CC number currently mapped to this prompt.\n*   `channel` (Number): The MIDI channel mapped to this prompt. This property is available but not currently used in the component's logic; it may be a remnant or intended for future use.\n*   `learnMode` (Boolean): A flag to indicate if the component is currently in MIDI CC learn mode.\n*   `showCC` (Boolean): Controls the visibility of the MIDI CC display and learn mode toggle.\n*   `midiDispatcher` (MidiDispatcher | null): An instance of `MidiDispatcher` used to listen for incoming MIDI CC messages.\n*   `audioLevel` (Number): The current audio analysis level, passed to the `WeightKnob` to potentially influence its visualization.\n\n### Methods\n\n*   `connectedCallback()`: Initializes event listeners for MIDI CC messages when the component is added to the DOM. It handles updating the prompt's weight based on received CC values or updating the mapped CC when in learn mode.\n*   `firstUpdated()`: Sets up the `contenteditable` attribute for the text input and initializes its content.\n*   `update(changedProperties)`: Handles updates to properties. It ensures the text input reflects the `text` property by setting `this.textInput.textContent = this.text;` and manages the `learnMode` state when `showCC` changes.\n*   `dispatchPromptChange()`: A private method to dispatch the `prompt-changed` custom event with the current prompt details.\n*   `onKeyDown(e: KeyboardEvent)`: Handles keyboard events for the text input, specifically for 'Enter' to save and 'Escape' to reset.\n*   `resetText()`: Resets the prompt text to its last valid state.\n*   `updateText()`: Updates the prompt's text property and dispatches the `prompt-changed` event after the user finishes editing.\n*   `onFocus()`: Selects the content of the text input when it gains focus.\n*   `updateWeight()`: Updates the prompt's weight based on input from the `WeightKnob` and dispatches the `prompt-changed` event.\n*   `toggleLearnMode()`: Toggles the `learnMode` property.\n\n### Usage Example\n\n```html\n<prompt-controller\n  promptId=\"prompt-0\"\n  text=\"Bossa Nova\"\n  weight=\"1.5\"\n  color=\"#9900ff\"\n  .midiDispatcher=${midiDispatcherInstance} // Placeholder for an actual MidiDispatcher instance\n  ?showCC=${true}\n  @prompt-changed=${handlePromptChange}> // Placeholder for an event handler function\n</prompt-controller>\n```\n\nThis component is crucial for allowing users to define and control the various musical elements that the AI will generate, providing a direct link between MIDI input and the creative output."},{"path":"components/PromptDjMidi.md","content":"## Component: `PromptDjMidi`\n\n### Purpose\n\nThe `PromptDjMidi` component orchestrates the user interface for the real-time music generation application. It displays a grid of individual prompt controllers, manages global playback controls, and facilitates MIDI device selection and connection.\n\n### Grid Layout\n\n- The component renders a grid of `prompt-controller` elements.\n- The grid is configured to have 4 columns (`grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr);`) and a defined gap (`gap: 2.5vmin;`).\n- The overall grid container (`#grid`) is responsive, with its size determined by `80vmin` for both width and height.\n- Each `prompt-controller` within the grid is styled to occupy its grid cell effectively (`width: 100%;`).\n\n### Prompt Management\n\n- The component maintains an internal `Map` called `prompts` to store the state of each prompt (e.g., text, weight, color, associated MIDI CC).\n- It listens for `prompt-changed` events emitted by individual `prompt-controller` components. When a prompt's properties are updated, this component updates its internal `prompts` map and dispatches a `prompts-changed` event to inform other parts of the application (like `LiveMusicHelper`).\n- The `makeBackground` method generates dynamic radial gradients for the component's background. These gradients visually represent the weights of active prompts, with brighter and larger gradients indicating higher weights. The `alphaPct` and `stop` values are directly tied to `p.weight`, with `MAX_WEIGHT` and `MAX_ALPHA` constants controlling the maximum visual influence.\n\n### MIDI Input Handling\n\n- The component integrates with the `MidiDispatcher` utility to handle MIDI input.\n- It provides a UI section (toggleable via a 'MIDI' button) to:\n  - List available MIDI input devices.\n  - Allow the user to select an active MIDI input device.\n  - Display the selected device's name.\n- If no MIDI devices are found, a corresponding message is shown.\n- If the browser does not support the Web MIDI API, an error message will be displayed.\n- The `setShowMidi` method is responsible for requesting MIDI access and updating the list of available input IDs.\n\n### Playback Controls\n\n- A `play-pause-button` component is rendered, displaying the current `playbackState` ('stopped', 'playing', 'loading', 'paused').\n- Clicking the `play-pause-button` dispatches a `play-pause` event to the parent application, triggering the music playback or pause action.\n\n### Styling and Responsiveness\n\n- The component uses CSS custom properties and `vmin` units to ensure a degree of responsiveness.\n- The background is dynamically generated using radial gradients based on prompt weights, providing a visual feedback mechanism.\n- Specific styles are applied for the MIDI selection dropdown and the 'MIDI' button to indicate its active state.\n\n### Properties\n\n- `showMidi`: (Boolean) Controls the visibility of the MIDI device selection UI.\n- `playbackState`: (PlaybackState) Reflects the current playback status (e.g., 'playing', 'stopped').\n- `audioLevel`: (Number) Represents the current audio input level, used for visual feedback in `prompt-controller` components.\n- `midiInputIds`: (Array<string>) Stores the IDs of available MIDI input devices.\n- `activeMidiInputId`: (String | null) Stores the ID of the currently selected MIDI input device.\n- `filteredPrompts`: (Set<string>) A set of prompt texts that are currently filtered out by the AI. This property is used to visually indicate filtered prompts in the `prompt-controller` components by applying a specific style when a prompt's text is present in this set.\n- `prompts`: (Map<string, Prompt>) Internal state holding all prompt data.\n- `midiDispatcher`: (MidiDispatcher) An instance of the `MidiDispatcher` for handling MIDI messages.\n\n### Events\n\n- `prompts-changed`: Dispatched when the properties of any prompt are updated. The event detail contains the updated `Map<string, Prompt>`, which is crucial for updating the AI model's context.\n- `play-pause`: Dispatched when the play/pause button is clicked.\n- `error`: Dispatched when an error occurs (e.g., MIDI connection issues)."},{"path":"components/ToastMessage.md","content":"## ToastMessage Component Documentation Revision\n\nThe `ToastMessage` component is a custom LitElement web component designed to display temporary, non-intrusive user notifications (toasts) within the application. It is positioned fixedly at the top-center of the viewport and can be automatically dismissed or manually closed by the user.\n\n### Purpose\n\nTo provide essential feedback to the user about application status, errors, or confirmations without disrupting their current workflow. This component is crucial for informing users about events such as MIDI connection issues, AI prompt filtering, or other brief status updates.\n\n### Features\n\n*   **Dynamic Messaging:** Accepts a `message` property of type `string`. This string can contain URLs, which are automatically detected and rendered as clickable `<a>` elements using the `renderMessageWithLinks` internal method and a regular expression `/(https?:\\/\\/[^\\s]+)/g`.\n*   **Visibility Control:** Managed by the `showing` boolean property. When `true`, the toast is displayed and animated in; when `false`, it animates out and is effectively hidden.\n*   **Animated Transitions:** Leverages CSS transitions for smooth entry and exit animations. The animation uses a `cubic-bezier` timing function (`0.19, 1, 0.22, 1`) and is controlled by the `.toast:not(.showing)` CSS class for the exit animation.\n*   **Manual Dismissal:** Provides a close button ('✕') that triggers the `hide()` method for immediate user dismissal.\n*   **Automatic Dismissal:** The toast automatically animates out when the `showing` property is set to `false`.\n*   **Styling:** The component is styled to be fixed at the top-center of the viewport, with a dark background, white text, and distinct border and shadow for clear visibility.\n\n### Properties\n\n*   `message`: `string` - The content of the toast notification. URLs within this string will be rendered as hyperlinks.\n*   `showing`: `boolean` - A flag that controls the visibility and animation state of the toast. `true` displays the toast; `false` initiates the dismissal animation.\n\n### Methods\n\n*   `show(message: string)`: Public method to display the toast with the specified `message`. Sets the `showing` property to `true` and updates the `message` property.\n*   `hide()`: Public method to dismiss the toast. Sets the `showing` property to `false`, which triggers the exit animation.\n\n### Internal Implementation Details\n\n*   The `renderMessageWithLinks()` method is a private helper responsible for parsing the `message` string and converting any detected URLs into interactive `<a>` elements.\n*   The CSS styling utilizes `position: fixed`, `transform: translateX(-50%)` for centering, and `transition` properties for animating the toast's appearance and disappearance.\n"},{"path":"components/WeightKnob.md","content":"## Component: WeightKnob\n\n### Purpose\n\nThe `WeightKnob` component serves as an interactive control for adjusting and visualizing the \"weight\" of a prompt. It provides a visual representation of the prompt's importance or influence, allowing users to intuitively modify this value.\n\n### Visual Representation\n\n-   **Knob Interface**: A circular knob interface is used for adjusting the weight. The current value is indicated by a pointer that rotates around the knob.\n-   **Halo Effect**: A colored halo surrounds the knob. Its size is dynamically adjusted based on:\n    -   The current `value` of the knob (representing prompt weight).\n    -   The `audioLevel` input, which can further scale the halo.\n    -   The halo is visible only when the `value` is greater than 0.\n-   **Static Elements**: The component includes several static SVG elements that create a layered, visual depth for the knob.\n\n### Interactive Features\n\n-   **Pointer Interaction**: Users can click and drag on the knob to adjust its `value`. The component tracks the interaction to calculate the change in `value`.\n-   **Wheel Interaction**: Mouse wheel events can also be used to adjust the knob's `value`.\n-   **Value Clamping**: The `value` is constrained between 0 and 2. This range is chosen to represent a specific weighting scale for AI prompt generation.\n\n### Properties\n\n- `value` (Number): The current weight value, ranging from 0 to 2. Defaults to 0.\n- `color` (String): The color of the halo when the prompt is active. Defaults to '#000'.\n- `audioLevel` (Number): A value representing the current audio level, used to modify the halo's scale. Defaults to 0.\n\n### Events\n\n- `input` (CustomEvent<number>): Fired whenever the `value` of the knob changes due to user interaction (drag or wheel). The event detail contains the new `value`.\n\n### Usage Example\n\n```html\n<weight-knob\n  value=\"0.5\"\n  color=\"#9900ff\"\n  audioLevel=\"0.3\"\n  @input=\"(e) => console.log('Weight changed:', e.detail)\">\n</weight-knob>\n```"},{"path":"index.ts.md","content":"## `index.tsx` - Application Entry Point and Setup\n\nThis file serves as the main entry point for the PromptDJ MIDI myfirstanalog application.

Environment variables are utilized here for this purpose.\n    *   The `lyria-realtime-exp` model is selected for music generation.\n    *   `LiveMusicHelper` is instantiated to manage the interaction with the AI model, audio processing, and playback control.\n    *   `AudioAnalyser` is created to monitor audio levels. Its output node is connected to the `LiveMusicHelper` via `extraDestination` to enable real-time audio level monitoring.\n\n2.  **Component Instantiation and Appending:**\n    *   The primary UI component, `PromptDjMidi`, is instantiated with initial prompts and appended to the document body.\n    *   A `ToastMessage` component is instantiated for displaying user notifications and also appended to the document body.\n\n3.  **Event Handling and Component Communication:**\n    *   **`prompts-changed` Event:** Listens for changes in prompts from `PromptDjMidi`. When detected, it updates the `LiveMusicHelper` with the latest prompt configurations.\n    *   **`play-pause` Event:** Listens for the play/pause action from `PromptDjMidi` and delegates it to `LiveMusicHelper`.\n    *   **`playback-state-changed` Event:** Listens for changes in the playback state from `LiveMusicHelper`. It updates the `PromptDjMidi`'s playback state and controls the `AudioAnalyser` (starting it when playing, stopping it when not).\n    *   **`filtered-prompt` Event:** Listens for filtered prompts from `LiveMusicHelper`. It displays a notification using `ToastMessage` and adds the prompt to the `PromptDjMidi`'s filtered list.\n    *   **`error` Event:** Catches errors from both `LiveMusicHelper` and `PromptDjMidi`, displaying them to the user via `ToastMessage`.\n    *   **`audio-level-changed` Event:** Listens for audio level updates from `AudioAnalyser` and propagates them to `PromptDjMidi` to update its UI (likely for visual feedback on knobs).\n\n### Initial Prompt Setup (`buildInitialPrompts`)\n\n*   This function generates the initial set of prompts used when the application loads.\n*   It selects three random prompts from a predefined list (`DEFAULT_PROMPTS`) to be initially active (weight of 1).\n*   The remaining prompts are initialized with a weight of 0.\n*   Each prompt is assigned a unique `promptId`, its `text`, `weight`, `cc` (MIDI Continuous Controller number, mapped sequentially to the prompt index), and `color`.\n*   These prompts are stored in a `Map` and returned.\n\n### `DEFAULT_PROMPTS`\n\nA constant array defining the default prompts, each with a `color` and `text` description. This list serves as the source for generating the initial prompts and provides the basis for the AI's musical context.\n\n### Usage\n\nThis file is executed automatically when the application is loaded in a browser environment. It sets up the entire application by:\n1.  Creating and appending the main UI and notification components.\n2.  Initializing the AI and audio processing backend.\n3.  Establishing the communication channels (event listeners) between the UI and the backend logic.\n1.  Calling `buildInitialPrompts` to prepare the initial state of the music generation prompts.\n\nIt represents the core bootstrapping mechanism of the PromptDJ MIDI myfirstanalog application.\n\n**Note on Environment Variables:** The API key is loaded via `process.env.GEMINI_API_KEY`. Vite typically uses `import.meta.env` for environment variables; ensure that `process.env` is correctly configured or polyfilled in the build process for this project if `process.env` is indeed the intended method of access in the final bundle.\n\n**Note on Event Handling:** Type assertions (e.g., `e as CustomEvent<...>`) are used within event listeners to provide specific type information for event details. This is a common practice in TypeScript for enhancing type safety and clarity when dealing with custom events."},{"path":"types.ts","content":"/**\n * @license\n * SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0\n*/\n\n/**\n * Defines the core data structures and interfaces used throughout the PromptDJ MIDI myfirstanalog project.\n * These types ensure type safety and provide a clear understanding of the data being passed between different parts of the application, such as prompt configurations, MIDI inputs, and playback status.\n */\n\n/**\n * Represents a single controllable prompt within the application.\n * @property {string} promptId - A unique identifier for the prompt.\n * @property {string} text - The actual text content of the prompt.\n * @property {number} weight - The current weight or intensity of the prompt, typically ranging from 0 to 2.

It leverages the Web Audio API's `AnalyserNode` to capture frequency data and then computes an average level, which is dispatched as an event.\n\n### `AudioAnalyser` Class\n\nThis class extends `EventTarget` to allow other parts of the application to subscribe to audio level changes.\n\n#### Constructor\n\n-   **`constructor(context: AudioContext)`**:\n    -   Initializes the `AudioAnalyser` by creating an `AnalyserNode` from the provided `AudioContext`.\n    -   Configures the `AnalyserNode` with `smoothingTimeConstant = 0` for immediate feedback.\n    -   Initializes a `Uint8Array` (`freqData`) to store frequency bin magnitudes.\n    -   Binds the `loop` method to ensure correct `this` context.\n\n#### Methods\n\n-   **`getCurrentLevel(): number`**:\n    -   Retrieves the current audio frequency data from the `AnalyserNode` into the `freqData` array.\n    -   Calculates the average magnitude across all frequency bins.\n    -   Normalizes the average value to a range between 0 and 1 (by dividing by `0xff`, the maximum possible value for a frequency bin).\n    -   Returns the normalized average audio level.\n\n-   **`loop(): void`**:\n    -   This method is intended to be called repeatedly, typically via `requestAnimationFrame`.\n    -   It calls `getCurrentLevel()` to get the audio level.\n    -   Dispatches a custom event named `audio-level-changed` with the calculated level as `detail`.\n    -   Schedules itself to run again using `requestAnimationFrame`.\n\n-   **`start(): void`**:\n    -   Alias for the `loop` method. Call this to begin the audio level monitoring loop.\n\n-   **`stop(): void`**:\n    -   Cancels the animation frame request, effectively stopping the `loop` and subsequent event dispatches.\n\n#### Events\n\n-   **`audio-level-changed`**:\n    -   Dispatched whenever `loop()` is executed.\n    -   `detail`: A `number` representing the normalized current audio level (0 to 1).\n\n#### Integration with `LiveMusicHelper`\n\nThe `AudioAnalyser` can serve as an `extraDestination` for the `LiveMusicHelper`. By connecting the `outputNode` of `LiveMusicHelper` to the `node` of `AudioAnalyser`, the `AudioAnalyser` can process the audio output from the AI model, allowing the application to visualize the AI-generated music's volume levels.\n\n```typescript\n// Example Usage:\n\nimport { AudioAnalyser } from './utils/AudioAnalyser';\n\n// Assume 'liveMusicHelper' is an instance of LiveMusicHelper\n// and 'pdjMidi' is an instance of PromptDjMidi\n\nconst audioAnalyser = new AudioAnalyser(liveMusicHelper.audioContext);\n// Connect the output of LiveMusicHelper to the AnalyserNode\nliveMusicHelper.extraDestination = audioAnalyser.node;\n\n// Listen for audio level changes\naudioAnalyser.addEventListener('audio-level-changed', (e) => {\n  const level = (e as CustomEvent<number>).detail;\n  pdjMidi.audioLevel = level; // Update UI component\n});\n\n// To start monitoring:\n// audioAnalyser.start();\n\n// To stop monitoring:\n// audioAnalyser.stop();\n```"},{"path":"utils/LiveMusicHelper.md","content":"## `utils/LiveMusicHelper.ts`\n\nThis utility class acts as the primary bridge between the frontend components and the `@google/genai` library for real-time music generation. It manages the connection to the AI model, processes incoming audio data, handles prompt weighting, and controls the playback state.\n\n### Purpose\n\n- Facilitate real-time music generation by interacting with the Google Generative AI API.\n- Process and manage audio chunks received from the AI model.\n- Control the playback state (playing, paused, stopped, loading).\n- Handle prompt filtering and dispatch notifications for filtered prompts.\n- Allow for external audio processing nodes (e.g., audio level analysis) to be connected.\n\n### Key Properties\n\n*   `ai`: An instance of `GoogleGenAI` used to interact with the API.\n*   `model`: The identifier for the AI music generation model.\n*   `session`: The current `LiveMusicSession` object, representing the active connection to the AI service. It is initialized lazily.\n*   `sessionPromise`: A promise that resolves to the `LiveMusicSession`, used for managing concurrent connection attempts.\n*   `connectionError`: A boolean flag indicating if a connection error has occurred.\n*   `filteredPrompts`: A `Set` storing the text of prompts that have been filtered by the AI.\n*   `nextStartTime`: The scheduled start time for the next audio chunk in the `AudioContext`.\n*   `bufferTime`: A buffer period (in seconds) to ensure smooth playback initiation.\n*   `audioContext`: The Web Audio API `AudioContext` used for audio processing and playback.\n*   `extraDestination`: An optional `AudioNode` where audio can be routed for additional processing (e.g., `AudioAnalyser`).\n*   `outputNode`: A `GainNode` used to control the volume of the audio output.\n*   `playbackState`: The current state of the music playback (`stopped`, `playing`, `loading`, `paused`).\n*   `prompts`: A `Map` storing the current state of all prompts, including their text, weight, CC mapping, and color.\n\n### Core Methods\n\n*   `getSession()`: Returns the `LiveMusicSession`, establishing a connection if one does not already exist.\n*   `connect()`: Establishes a connection to the AI music generation service. It sets up callbacks for message handling (`onmessage`), errors (`onerror`), and connection closure (`onclose`).\n*   `setPlaybackState(state: PlaybackState)`: Updates the internal `playbackState` and dispatches a `playback-state-changed` event.\n*   `processAudioChunks(audioChunks: AudioChunk[])`: Decodes and schedules the playback of received audio data chunks using the `AudioContext`. It manages `nextStartTime` to ensure smooth, sequential playback and handles state transitions based on buffer timing.\n*   `activePrompts` (getter): Returns an array of prompts that are currently active (not filtered and have a weight greater than 0).\n*   `setWeightedPrompts(prompts: Map<string, Prompt>)`: Updates the AI model with the current set of weighted prompts. This method is throttled to prevent excessive API calls. It filters out inactive prompts before sending the update.\n*   `play()`: Initiates the music playback. It ensures a session is established, updates prompts, resumes the `AudioContext`, and starts the audio output.\n*   `pause()`: Pauses the music playback. It stops the AI session, sets the state to `paused`, and fades out the audio output.\n*   `stop()`: Stops the music playback entirely.

It simplifies the process of connecting to MIDI devices, listening for specific MIDI messages, and dispatching them as custom events. This allows components to react to MIDI controller inputs without needing to manage the complexities of the underlying API directly.\n\n### Core Functionality\n\n*   **MIDI Access Management:** The class handles the asynchronous request for MIDI access using `navigator.requestMIDIAccess()`. It manages the `MIDIAccess` object and provides a list of available MIDI input device IDs. The `sysex: false` option is used during the request, which means System Exclusive messages will not be processed, simplifying the message handling logic.\n*   **Device Selection:** It allows for the selection of a specific MIDI input device via the `activeMidiInputId` property. If multiple devices are available, the first one is automatically selected upon successful connection if `activeMidiInputId` is not already set.\n*   **MIDI Message Processing:** It attaches an `onmidimessage` event listener to the selected MIDI input device. This listener filters incoming MIDI messages.\n*   **Control Change (CC) Message Dispatching:** The dispatcher specifically identifies Control Change (CC) messages (status byte `0xb0` to `0xbf`). When a CC message is received from the active device, it extracts the channel, CC number (`data[1]`), and value (`data[2]`) and dispatches a custom `cc-message` event. The `event.detail` will contain an object conforming to the `ControlChange` interface.\n*   **Device Name Retrieval:** Provides a method to get the user-friendly name of a MIDI device given its ID.\n\n### Key Classes and Methods\n\n*   **`MidiDispatcher` Class:**\n    *   **`constructor()`:** Initializes the `MidiDispatcher` instance.\n    *   **`activeMidiInputId: string | null`:** A public property that holds the ID of the currently active MIDI input device. Setting this property can switch the dispatcher's focus to a different device.\n    *   **`async getMidiAccess(): Promise<string[]>`:** Asynchronously requests MIDI access. Returns a promise that resolves with an array of MIDI input device IDs. If access has already been granted, it returns the stored IDs immediately. It also sets up the `onmidimessage` listener for the active input.\n    *   **`getDeviceName(id: string): string | null`:** Returns the name of the MIDI input device associated with the given `id`, or `null` if the device is not found or MIDI access is not yet established.\n\n### Events\n\n*   **`cc-message`:** Dispatched when a Control Change MIDI message is received from the active MIDI input device. The event detail is of type `ControlChange`.\n\n### Usage Example\n\n```typescript\nimport { MidiDispatcher } from './utils/MidiDispatcher';\nimport type { ControlChange } from './types';\n\n// In your component or application setup:\nconst midiDispatcher = new MidiDispatcher();\n\nasync function initializeMidi() {\n  try {\n    const inputIds = await midiDispatcher.getMidiAccess();\n    console.log('Available MIDI inputs:', inputIds);\n    // Optionally, set a specific input if needed:\n    // if (inputIds.length > 0) {\n    //   midiDispatcher.activeMidiInputId = inputIds[0];\n    // }\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error('Failed to initialize MIDI:', error);\n    // Display an error message to the user\n  }\n}\n\n// Add an event listener for CC messages:\nmidiDispatcher.addEventListener('cc-message', (event: Event) => {\n  const customEvent = event as CustomEvent<ControlChange>;\n  const { channel, cc, value } = customEvent.detail;\n  console.log(`MIDI CC: Channel=${channel}, CC=${cc}, Value=${value}`);\n  // Handle the CC message, e.g., map it to a control\n});\n\n// Call initializeMidi() when the application is ready or user interaction occurs\ninitializeMidi();\n```\n\n### Error Handling\n\nThe class includes robust error handling for:\n\n*   Browsers lacking Web MIDI API support.\n*   Failures during the MIDI access request.\n*   Situations where MIDI messages might not contain expected data."},{"path":"utils/audio.md","content":"## `utils/audio.ts` Documentation\n\nThis module provides utility functions for handling audio data, specifically for encoding, decoding, and creating a data structure compatible with the AI library's audio input requirements.\n\n### Functions:\n\n*   **`encode(bytes: Uint8Array): string`**\n    *   **Purpose:** Converts a `Uint8Array` into a Base64 encoded string.\n    *   **Mechanism:** Iterates through the byte array, converting each byte to its corresponding character and concatenating them into a binary string, which is then Base64 encoded using `btoa()`.\n    *   **Usage:** Typically used to serialize binary audio data into a string format suitable for transmission or storage, such as within JSON payloads for API requests.\n\n*   **`decode(base64: string): Uint8Array`**\n    *   **Purpose:** Decodes a Base64 encoded string back into a `Uint8Array`.\n    *   **Mechanism:** Decodes the Base64 string into a binary string using `atob()`, then creates a `Uint8Array` from the character codes of the binary string.\n    *   **Usage:** Used to deserialize audio data that was previously encoded and transmitted as a Base64 string.\n\n*   **`createBlob(data: Float32Array): Blob`**\n    *   **Purpose:** Converts `Float32Array` audio data into a structure compatible with the `@google/genai` library's audio input format.\n    *   **Mechanism:** \n        1.  Converts the input `Float32Array` (typically ranging from -1.0 to 1.0) into an `Int16Array` (ranging from -32768 to 32767).\n        2.  Creates a `Uint8Array` from the buffer of the `Int16Array`.\n        3.  Encodes this `Uint8Array` using the `encode` function.\n        4.  Returns an object with the encoded `data` and a fixed `mimeType` of `audio/pcm;rate=16000`.\n    *   **Note:** The returned `Blob` is a custom object structure for the AI library, not a standard browser `Blob` object.\n    *   **Usage:** Prepares audio data for sending to the AI model, ensuring the correct format and encoding.\n\n*   **`decodeAudioData(data: Uint8Array, ctx: AudioContext, sampleRate: number, numChannels: number): Promise<AudioBuffer>`**\n    *   **Purpose:** Decodes raw audio data (expected to be PCM 16-bit signed integers) into an `AudioBuffer` object.\n    *   **Mechanism:** \n        1.  Creates an `AudioBuffer` with the specified `numChannels`, calculated length, and `sampleRate`.\n        2.  Interprets the input `Uint8Array` as an `Int16Array`.\n        3.  Converts the `Int16Array` samples to `Float32Array` samples normalized to the range [-1.0, 1.0].\n        4.  De-interleaves the samples for each channel and copies them into the respective channels of the `AudioBuffer`.\n    *   **Usage:** Converts received audio data into a format that can be played back or further processed by the Web Audio API.\n\n### Notes:\n\n*   The `createBlob` function's `mimeType` is hardcoded to `audio/pcm;rate=16000`. This sample rate is specific to the expected input format of the AI model.\n*   The `decodeAudioData` function assumes the input `data` is in 16-bit signed integer PCM format. The calculation `data.length / 2 / numChannels` determines the number of samples per channel by first converting bytes to samples (`data.length / 2`) and then dividing by the number of channels. The calculation for `frameCount` has been updated to `data.length / (numChannels * 2)` for accuracy.\n"},{"path":"utils/throttle.md","content":"The `utils/throttle.ts` file exports a utility function named `throttle`. This function is designed to limit the execution rate of another function, ensuring it's called at most once within a specified time interval.\n\n**Purpose:**\nThrottling is crucial for optimizing performance, particularly for event handlers that can trigger frequently (e.g., `scroll`, `resize`, `mousemove`). By applying `throttle`, you prevent excessive function calls, thereby reducing unnecessary computations and improving application responsiveness.\n\n**How it works:**\nThe `throttle` function takes the target function (`func`) and a `delay` (in milliseconds) as arguments. It returns a new function that wraps `func`. This wrapper function internally tracks the timestamp of the last successful execution.\n\nWhen the throttled function is invoked:\n\n1.  It calculates the time elapsed since the last execution.\n2.  If the elapsed time is greater than or equal to the specified `delay`, it executes the original `func` with the provided arguments, updates the `lastCall` timestamp, and stores the return value of `func` in `lastResult`.\n3.  If the elapsed time is less than the `delay`, the function call is ignored, and the previously stored `lastResult` is returned.\n\nThis mechanism ensures that `func` is executed at most once within the `delay` period. The function also returns the result of the last successful execution, providing a way to access the most recent computed value even when a call is throttled.\n\n**Example Usage:**\n\n```typescript\nfunction handleScroll(event: Event) {\n  console.log('Scrolled!', Date.now());\n}\n\n// Throttle the scroll handler to be called at most once every 200ms\nconst throttledScrollHandler = throttle(handleScroll, 200);\n\nwindow.addEventListener('scroll', throttledScrollHandler);\n```\n\nIn this example, `handleScroll` will only be executed at most once every 200 milliseconds, even if the scroll event fires more frequently. The `throttledScrollHandler` will return the result of the last `handleScroll` execution.\n\n**Note on Return Value:** If the throttled function is called before the delay has passed since the last execution, the previously returned `lastResult` is returned. If this is the very first call and the delay hasn't passed, `lastResult` might be undefined, depending on the return type of the original function and TypeScript's inference."},{"path":"vite.config.ts","content":"## Vite Configuration (`vite.config.ts`)\n\nThe `vite.config.ts` file configures the Vite build tool for the PromptDJ MIDI myfirstanalog project.
