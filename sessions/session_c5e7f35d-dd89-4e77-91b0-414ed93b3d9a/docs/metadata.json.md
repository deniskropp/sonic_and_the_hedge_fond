The `metadata.json` file contains essential metadata about the PromptDJ MIDI myfirstanalog application, particularly for its integration within AI Studio or similar development environments. It defines the application's name, a brief description, and any specific permissions required for its operation.

**Purpose:**
This file serves to describe the application's core identity and requirements to the platform it's deployed on, enabling proper integration and functionality. For AI Studio, it helps in understanding the application's purpose and any special needs it might have, such as requesting permissions for specific browser features.

**Key Fields:**

*   **`name`**: (String) The display name of the application. Example: `"PromptDJ MIDI myfirstanalog"`.
*   **`description`**: (String) A concise summary of what the application does. Example: `"Control real time music with a MIDI controller."`.
*   **`requestFramePermissions`**: (Array of Strings) An array of strings, where each string represents a permission that the application might need to request from the user or the browser environment. This is often used for features that require explicit user consent or specific browser APIs. Example: `[]` (an empty array indicates no specific frame permissions are requested by default).
*   **`prompt`**: (String) This field is intended for any initial prompt or configuration that might be passed to the underlying AI model or system upon application initialization. In this case, it is empty, suggesting no default prompt is set. Example: `""`.
